<p>Before you start, let’s recap a bit of notation. Remember that rise over run is written:
\[ \frac{Rise}{Run} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{x+h-x} = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \,. \]</p>

<p>You need to consider the limit as \(h\) approaches \(0\). Or, formally:
\[ \lim_{h\to 0} \,. \]</p>

<p>Now the terminology for the derivative of \(y\) given your values \(x\) is noted:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} \,. \]
So this is the mathematical way of saying, 'I’m evaluating the derivative.'</p>

<p>Now, if you put all of that together, you get the whole function
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} \,. \]</p>

<p>This is the equation you need to work out the derivative using first principles.</p>

<p>So what does that look like in practice? Let’s go back to the equation in the Orientation section. The equation was:
\[ f(x) = 3 +2x \,. \]</p>

<p>And you showed that it had slope (or derivative!)  \(m=2\). But can you work that out using first principles? Let’s set up your equation:</p>

<p>First, you need to work out \(f(x+h)\):
\[ f(x+h) = 3 + 2(x+h) = 3 + 2x + 2h \,. \]</p>

<p>OK, now put it into your equation:
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}\\
&= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3 + 2x + 2h-(3 + 2x)}{h} \,. \end{aligned}\]</p>

<p>Now simplify it:
\[\begin{aligned}
\frac{dy}{dx} &= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{3 + 2x + 2h-3 - 2x}{h} \\
&= \lim_{h\to 0} \frac{2h}{h} \,. \end{aligned}\]</p>

<p>You should notice here that you have a common factor \(h\) in both the numerator and denominator. This should always be the case at this point. If you have anything that doesn’t have a \(h\) in it, you’ve done something incorrectly and should go back and check your working out.</p>

<p>From here, you can cancel out the common factor of \(h\)
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{h\to 0} 2 \,. \]</p>

<p>Now you take the limit (which is easy in this case because there are no \(h\)’s left!) and you get:
\[ \frac{dy}{dx} = 2 \]
which is exactly what you expected!</p>
