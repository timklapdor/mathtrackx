<p>Melissa is an ex-chef, wannabe psychologist who somehow got lost in the maths along the way. Specialising in statistics and cognitive modelling, Mel is a lecturer at the University of Adelaide. Her non-traditional pathway into maths makes her an empathetic teacher who can explain things to a wide variety of people. And she does cool research in forensic science and with illicit drugs… which some people say make her interesting to talk to… at least, that’s what she says.</p>
