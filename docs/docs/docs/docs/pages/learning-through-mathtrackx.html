<p>Learning through MathTrackX has been designed to assist you to develop your skills in communicating mathematical solutions and arguments, and to build your confidence in solving mathematical problems.</p>

<p>Here’s how the course will help you:</p>

<ol class="green-dark">
  <li>
    <h3 class="green-dark">Assess your existing confidence with the mathematical concepts in the course</h3>
    <p>First you can complete the self-evaluation questionnaire located here in the orientation section. The questionnaire will help you to identify the math concepts you need to spend most of your time learning about the concepts you should spend a small amount of time revising, and those concepts you already know but might want to test. On completion of the questionnaire, you’ll be provided with a recommended personal learning pathway through the course.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="green-dark">Follow your own recommend learning pathway through the course</h3>
    <p>Throughout the course you will learn key concepts from learning videos, illustrated examples, interactive graphs and worked example videos. Members of the course team walk and talk you through math problems. They highlight the approaches that can be taken when solving problems as well as what to look out for while you are solving them</p>
  <li>
    <h3 class="green-dark">Consolidate your learning through regularly practicing to solve problems</h3>
    <p>You’ll then be able to consolidate what you’ve learnt by practising to answer Streak Test questions.Streak Test questions are not graded and will help you to evaluate and determine if you have understood a concept before moving on to the next part of the course. To complete Streak test questions, you will need to establish "a streak," which involves correctly answering 3 questions in a row.</p>
    <p>Quiz questions are introduced at around the halfway point in the course. They are also not graded. Quiz questions provide you with the opportunity to practise solving math problems that combine more than one concept from a number of topics.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 class="green-dark">When you’re ready, take the exam to demonstrate your new skills and knowledge</h3>
    <p>All of this will prepare you for the only assessment in this course, the timed exam which is worth 100% of your overall grade. </p>
    <p>You can take the exam at any time and you’ll get your final grade instantly after completion.</p>
</li>
