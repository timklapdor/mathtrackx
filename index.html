  <p>Consider, again, Monet’s haystack paintings. They’re a remarkable study of light, and wonderful from a purely aesthetic standpoint. But from a design standpoint, there’s a useful lesson to be found in them. In the words of another French impressionist, Pierre Bonnard, “Color does not add a pleasant quality to design—it reinforces it.” Remember the way the color of light affected the appearance of Monet’s haystacks. What if we could take our base colors and easily influence the color in our designs the way he did back in 1890?</p>
